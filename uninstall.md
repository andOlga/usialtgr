You can only uninstall this keyboard layout if it is _not_ the default keyboard layout. These steps will uninstall this keyboard layout:

  1. Open the [keyboard layout dialog](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-keyboard-layout).
  1. Change the default input language in the dropdown menu to something different than `English (United States) - United States-International (AltGr dead keys)` and click 'Apply'.
  1. [Download](http://code.google.com/p/usialtgr/downloads/list), extract and run setup.exe. You need not download the same version you have installed; the latest one will do just fine.
  1. The setup wizard will uninstall this keyboard layout.
  1. If you're going to install a newer version now, please reboot.
