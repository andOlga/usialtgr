A dead key is a special kind of a modifier key on a typewriter or computer keyboard that is typically used to attach a specific diacritic  to a base letter. The dead key does not generate a (complete) character by itself but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after.

For instance, when the [http://code.google.com/p/usialtgr/downloads/list United States-International (AltGr dead keys) layout] is used, pressing !AltGr+' will do nothing. Pressing !AltGr+' followed by E would produce é.
