Are you tired of tapping the space bar every time you hit the ' key? Compare before and after:

| **Before = US International** | **After = AltGr dead keys** | **Result** |
|:------------------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------|
| ', space | ' | ' |
| shift+', space | shift+' | " |
| ', e | AltGr+', e | é |
| shift+6, a | AltGr+Shift+6, a | â |
| etc. | etc. | etc. |

AltGr is simply the **right Alt key** on your keyboard. As you see, typing quotation marks becomes faster and typing accents (acute, umlaut, etc.) becomes slower. What do you do more often?
